> **TRACE** is a hybrid CLI and web-based Memory Forensics & Threat Analysis Framework that automates digital forensic investigations using Volatility3. It detects suspicious processes, malware indicators, forensic artifacts, injected memory regions, and system anomalies from memory dump files — through both a terminal forensic engine and a modern browser-based SOC dashboard.

---

## 🛡️ Project Overview

Traditional memory forensic investigations require analysts to manually execute multiple Volatility commands and interpret raw outputs, making investigations time-consuming and complex. TRACE addresses this by integrating automated forensic workflows, threat scoring, report generation, and visualization into a single unified platform.

It operates on two fronts:

- **CLI Forensic Engine**: Terminal-first memory analysis — process inspection, malware detection, artifact analysis, threat scoring, and JSON report generation. Optimized for large memory dumps, offline investigations, and advanced forensic workflows. Runs without the web stack.
- **Elite SOC Web Platform**: Browser-based interaction with dashboard visualization, memory dump uploads, forensic report viewing, and scan history tracking.

Both interfaces share the same Volatility3 analysis core and deterministic scoring engine, guaranteeing consistent results regardless of interface.

## 🔬 CLI Forensic Engine

The CLI is the technical backbone of TRACE. It runs entirely in the terminal without requiring the web stack — making it ideal for headless environments, rapid field triage, and direct Volatility3 workflows. For memory dumps above 200MB, the CLI engine is the recommended interface for improved stability and performance.

### Running the CLI

```bash
cd cli
python3 main.py
```

### Analysis Pipeline

```
[1] Memory Artifact Ingestion
      └── Accepts .raw / .dmp / .mem / .img / .vmem files
      └── Auto-detects OS (Windows / Linux)
      └── Optimized for large dumps (200MB+)

[2] Volatility3 Plugin Execution
      └── windows.pslist / linux.pslist   — Process enumeration
      └── windows.malfind / linux.malfind — Injected code regions
      └── Artifact and VAD inspection

[3] Process Analysis
      └── Identifies suspicious processes:
          powershell.exe, cmd.exe, mimikatz.exe, dumpit.exe, winrar.exe

[4] Artifact Analysis
      └── Temporary file usage
      └── Encoded PowerShell commands
      └── Suspicious shell execution
      └── Malware staging indicators

[5] Malware Detection
      └── PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE regions
      └── VadS unbacked memory entries
      └── Injected PE signatures

[6] Threat Scoring
      └── Dynamic scoring based on:
          suspicious process count + malware indicators + artifact findings
      └── Levels: LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH → CRITICAL

[7] Report Generation
      └── JSON forensic report → report_<timestamp>.json
      └── Human-readable summary in terminal
```

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### 1. Backend (Render)
- **Service Type**: `Web Service`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn backend.app:app`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `PORT`: `5001`
  - `FLASK_ENV`: `production`
  - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string from Render
  - `SECRET_KEY`: Your secure key

### 2. Frontend (Vercel)
- **Framework Preset**: `Vite`
- **Root Directory**: `frontend`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `VITE_API_URL`: Your Render backend URL (e.g. `https://trace-api.onrender.com`)

### 3. Database (PostgreSQL)
The local SQLite database resets on every Render deploy. Use Render's managed PostgreSQL instead:
1. Create a **Render PostgreSQL** instance.
2. Copy the **Internal Database URL**.
3. Set it as `DATABASE_URL` in your backend environment variables.
4. TRACE will automatically migrate the schema on next startup.

## 🔬 Deterministic Engine

TRACE eliminates the "black box" problem in threat scoring. The same memory dump will always produce the same forensic result — across both interfaces.

- **Reproducibility**: Peer-reviewable, consistent forensic findings.
- **Efficiency**: Instant results for previously analyzed artifacts via hash cache.
- **Auditability**: Clear mapping between detected indicators and threat scores.
- **Consistency**: CLI and web produce identical scores for identical inputs.
